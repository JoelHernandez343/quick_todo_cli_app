# Quick TODO App

CLI app developed primarily using [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) (pretty impressive ngl). It got all the details I gave it but I ran out of prompts too soon.

I added the edit command, improved some messages and commands and in-app help.

## TODO

-   [ ] Add gif to `README.md`
-   [ ] Add move items commands
-   [ ] Add import / export commands
-   [ ] Add build pipeline to build project into CLI command available into terminal environment
